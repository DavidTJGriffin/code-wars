A growing collection of Python kata I've completed on CodeWars. Just getting started, but each challenge helps sharpen my logic and fluency.

## How It's Made

**Tech Used:**

All solutions are in Python, written with readability in mind.

## Optimizations

I revisit problems to simplify logic and explore cleaner and more optimized solutions. Clarity over cleverness.

## Lessons Learned

Thereâ€™s always more than one way to solve a problem. Even simple challenges teach me new ways to think. I tend to initially approach problems with a brute force approach. I am working on building proficiency with algorithmic patterns in order to produce more optimized solutions. I am building an increasing pattern matching perception in terms of problem solving.
